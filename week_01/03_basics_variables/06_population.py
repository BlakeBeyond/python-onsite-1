'''
    In the U.S., if there is:
    - One person who is born every 6 seconds
    - One person who dies every 12 seconds
    - One person who immigrates every 40 seconds
    
    Write the necessary code to display the total population
    for the next 3 years (without a leap year).
    Let's say the current population is 380,123,456.
